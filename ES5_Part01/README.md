#Part 01 - JavaScript Quick Start

##1. Basic JavaScript

###Background

• JavaScript means the programming language.

• ECMAScript is the name used by the language specification. Therefore, whenever
referring to versions of the language, people say ECMAScript. The current version
of JavaScript is ECMAScript 5; ECMAScript 6 is currently being developed.

JavaScript enables a programming style that is a mixture of functional programming (higher-order functions; built-in map, reduce, etc.) and object-oriented programming (objects, inheritance).

###Syntax

• ***Statements*** “do things”. A program is a sequence of statements. Here is an example
of a statement, which declares (creates) a variable foo:

```var foo;```

• ***Expressions*** produce values. They are function arguments, the right side of an assignment, etc. Here’s an example of an expression:

```3 * 7```

###Variables and Assignment

Identifiers are names that play various syntactic roles in JavaScript. For example, the
name of a variable is an identifier. Identifiers are case sensitive.

The following identifiers are reserved words—they are part of the syntax and can’t be
used as variable names (including function names and parameter names):

- arguments 

- break 

- case 

- catch

- class 

- const 

- continue 

- debugger

- default 

- delete 

- do 

- else

- enum 

- export 

- extends 

- false

- finally 

- for 

- function 

- if

- implements 

- import 

- in 

- instanceof

- interface 

- let 

- new 

- null

- package 

- private 

- protected 

- public

- return 

- static 

- super 

- switch

- this 

- throw 

- true 

- try

- typeof 

- var 

- void 

- while

The following three identifiers are not reserved words, but you should treat them as if
they were:

- Infinity

- NaN

- undefined
